# Welcome to NovaCards 👋
## Who are we?

NovaCards is an intelligent web application designed to help medical students find Anki cards relevant to their studies. We utilize machine learning to help you cut down on the time you spend searching for cards and tags related to your lecture content for the AnKing card deck. 

As medical students ourselves, we know that it can take up to **two hours a day** to find relevant cards and tags from high quality pre-made decks such as the AnKing deck. NovaCards was designed to eliminate this wasted effort. By simply uploading lecture materials, textbook chapters, notes, or other study materials, our app will allow users to find the most relevant study materials in mere seconds. As medical students ourselves, we know how important every bit of time can be to acheive success in medical school.

## The Future
While we believe NovaCards is already a very useful study tool, we plan on adding many improvements in the future. Beyond simply finding cards, we are planning to use AI to remove _all nonessential work_ associated with maintaining a flashcard deck. This includes, creating cards, finding cards, identifying areas of weakness in studying, better collaborating with peers, and more. In doing so, students will be empowered to study more efficiently, and have more time to make meaningful contributions in research, spend time volunteering or with families, or mastering additional content. Additionally, we plan on expanding from just medicine to nursing, law, business, undergraduate studies, and more. While NovaCards was initially designed to aid medical students in their study process, we beleieve it has the potential to make studying much more efficient for all students around the world.
